# Quiz-Application
The GUI Quiz Application is an interactive and dynamic quiz program developed using Python's Tkinter library and the Open Trivia DB API. It offers users a captivating quiz experience by fetching trivia questions from a vast database that covers various categories, difficulty levels, and question types.

Each time the quiz is taken, the application randomly selects 50 questions from the API, ensuring a unique quiz experience with every attempt. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to easily navigate through the quiz and select answers for multiple-choice questions.

The Quiz App provides immediate feedback on each answer, indicating whether it is correct or incorrect. Once all the questions have been answered, users can click the "Submit" button to view their quiz results. The application then calculates the user's score based on the number of correct answers and displays it on the screen, providing a comprehensive overview of their performance.
